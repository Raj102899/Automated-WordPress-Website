Create a Policy
 Create a policy to start and stop the ec2 function and also has permission to connect to the VPC endpoint.

Create a role
Create a role from the earlier created policy

Create a lambda function
Create a lambda function and use the code under the role created.
Stop the instances:-
import boto3
region = 'us-west-1'
instances = ['i-12345cb6de4f78g9h', 'i-08ce9b2d7eccf6d26']
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name=region)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=instances)
    print('stopped your instances: ' + str(instances))

Start the instances:-
import boto3
region = 'us-west-1'
instances = ['i-12345cb6de4f78g9h', 'i-08ce9b2d7eccf6d26']
ec2 = boto3.client('ec2', region_name=region)

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ec2.start_instances(InstanceIds=instances)
    print('started your instances: ' + str(instances))

Create an event bridge rule to schedule the start and stop of the instance by using the lambda function.
use the cron function to create events. and

add sns function to get alerts to mail or phone number.
Create an event in the event bridge for state change and choose the state for which the SNS topic is to be invoked. 
set the target to sns topic.
